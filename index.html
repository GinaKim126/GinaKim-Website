        Attached below is a sample of Ginaâ€™s papers as an undergraduate Sociology student:
Crime in itself is a rather complex phenomenon that does not have one set answer or a cause. Instead, it is more often than not a result of different factors such as background, environment, or even self. There is a common misconception that when an individual commits a crime, one element, whether nature or nurture, weighs in significantly more heavily as an influence or a catalyst to such action. The fact that there is often an additional question of whether or not the act of crime that an individual commits is a result of the individual's nature, which would be their biological origins, or nurture, the environment in which the individual is raised. In sociology, various theories on observing society and its structure and how this may affect an individual's day-to-day life and actions. Certain theories in sociology, in this case, can be utilized to explain as to why an individual may be influenced to commit a crime. One theory in particular that effectively observes the phenomenon that is committing a crime would be a type of structural theory called the General Strain Theory by Robert Agnew. 
The strain theory pertains to the idea that crime is caused or committed by an individual due to societal pressures, such as financial hardships, lack of education, and lack of support. The strain theory considers an individual's background, such as their income and history, of whether or not said individual who has committed a crime has been victimized or has been exposed to criminal behavior in their formative years. This theory states that these negative experiences can lead to an increased chance of the individual committing criminal behavior. This rather introspective approach is efficient as it can also reveal the factors that come into play when an individual deviates from societal expectations as they face more societal strains. One of the most commonly committed crimes in the United States is theft, which is concerningly on the rise. By utilizing strain theory, sociologists can gain insight into why theft is on the rise by observing the crime's location and the suspect's socioeconomic background and history through records. Strain theory can offer an insight into the social strains that the suspect has been facing that had acted as a catalyst to the individual committing theft which can often be in the form of financial difficulties or a lack of career opportunities that ultimately ends in financial hardships. With a lack of means of meeting financial goals, individuals have no opportunity to meet them through conformity; they must utilize unconventional means to reach their goals. In the case of theft, these individuals may steal items to reach their financial goals or financial security as a means of coping with the negative position they are in.
<br><br>
All in all, General Strain theory is a very effective way of analyzing criminal phenomena, especially in analyzing why individuals tend to deviate from societal norms and rebel from conformity, coping in rather unorthodox means of reaching their goals. This would also help with finding the root cause of the issue, and in these cases, the lack of opportunities and resources provided by higher institutions can be very well noted. By finding the root cause, the issue of increasing crime rates can be quelled, allowing people to work towards rehabilitation and creating a healthier and stronger society.
